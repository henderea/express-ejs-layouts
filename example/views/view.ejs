When style extraction is enabled, any custom styles that a page defines, will
be extracted out of the content and made available in the specific placeholder.
In our example, even though we're defining a <style> within the body, this will
be placed, according to our layout, inside of the <head> element.
<link> blocks to load external stylesheets are also extracted when the option
is enabled.
